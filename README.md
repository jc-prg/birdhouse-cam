* Prepare a Raspberry Pi 3B or newer
  * Install a fresh image on an SDCard (https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
  * Recommended OS (due to restrictions: PyTorch require 64bit, picamera doesn't support 64bit any more, 
    and picamera2 + libcamera doesn't work in docker container yet (requires Raspbian OS 64bit > bullseye)) 
    * Raspbian OS Lite 64bit for **object detection** using YOLOv8
    * Raspbian OS Lite 32bit if you want to use a **PiCamera** and the Docker version 
      
  * Install git: ```sudo apt-get install git```
  * _Optional:_ Install v4l2-ctl: ```sudo apt-get install v4l-utils```
  * Create and move to your project directory, e.g., /projects/test/ or /projects/prod/ 
* Choose one of the installation procedures below depending on your needs 
* Connect cameras (and optional devices) with the Raspberry, start and enjoy

_NOTE: For an upgrade of an existing older version it might be required
to rename (or remove) the files 'data/config.json' and '.env' and restart after the update. 
Then change the new default configuration to your needs ..._

### Getting sources

```bash 
git clone http://github.com/jc-prg/birdhouse-cam.git
cd birdhouse-cam
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Software installation

Depending on the needs there are three options available how to install and run this software:

*  [(1) Docker based installation](#1-docker-based-installation) - the easiest way to install and run the birdhouse-cam, 
  but with limitations: you have to decide if you want to use a PiCamera on a 32bit OS or 
  object detection with 64bit OS. On 32bit systems the server functionality is limited, e.g., audio streaming (mp3 via lameenc) doesn't work. 
* [(2) Direct installation](#2-direct-installation) - complete installation of all components with a bigger effort but without the limitations of (1)
* [(3) Hybrid installation](#3-hybrid-installation) - combination with less effort than (2) and without the limitations
  of (1), recommend if you want to use PiCamera and object detection
* [(4) Update existing installation](#4-update-existing-installation) - update your existing installation

#### (1) Docker based installation

1. Install docker and docker-compose
    ```bash
    sudo ./config/install/install_docker
    ```
2. Create and adapt main configuration file, see [sample.env](sample.env) for details and ensure 
   the right settings especially regarding the directories, the container images and the rpi_* settings
    ```bash
    sudo cp sample.env .env
    sudo nano .env
    ```
3. Build docker container and run the first time
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
4. Initial start to create a config file, see [First run and device configuration](#First-run-and-device-configuration)
5. Add the following lines to crontab (start on boot):
    ```bash 
    @reboot /usr/sbin/docker-compose -f /<path_to_script>/docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```
6. Examine logging messages if there are any problems
   ```bash
   # show complete log file
   cat log/server.log
   
   # show latest log messages with an update every 2s
   ./watch_log
   ```

#### (2) Hybrid installation

1. Install docker and docker-compose, see (1.1)

2. Install birdhouse-cam prerequisites
    ```bash 
    # Install required Python modules and ffmpeg (this may take a while)
    sudo ./config/install/install       # for installation on x86
    sudo ./config/install/install_rpi   # for installation on Raspberry Pi
                                          # $ sudo ./config/install/install_ffmpeg
    ```

3. Create and adapt main configuration file, see (1.2). 

   Ensure the following variable is set correctly: ```BIRDHOUSE_INSTALLATION_TYPE=HYBRID```

4. Build docker container and run the first time
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-hybrid.yml up --build
    ```
5. Initial start to create a config file, see  [First run and device configuration](#First-run-and-device-configuration)
    ```bash 
    # Initial start, will create a config file
    ./server/server.py
    ```
6. Add the following lines to crontab (start on boot):
    ```
    @reboot /usr/sbin/docker-compose -f /<path_to_script>/docker-compose-hybrid.yml up -d
    ```
7. Enable starting when the server starts:

   1. Install via ```sudo crontab -e```. Add the following lines:
       ```
      # birdhouse-cam: start database, web-server, and videoserver
      @reboot     /usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /<path_to_script>/docker-compose-hybrid.yml up -docker
      
      # birdhouse-cam: start birdhouse server
      @reboot     /usr/bin/python3 /<path_to_script>/server/server.py
      
      # birdhouse-cam: start if restart has been requested 
      * * * * *   /usr/bin/python3 /<path_to_script>/server/server.py --check-if-start > /tmp/birdhouse-cam-cron 2>&1
       ```
   
   2. Alternatively create a system service to automatically start and restart the server (experimental)
       ```bash 
       # create and configure services
       sudo cp ./sample.birdhouse-cam.service /etc/systemd/system/birdhouse-cam.service
       sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/birdhouse-cam.service

       sudo cp ./sample.birdhouse-cam.service /etc/systemd/system/birdhouse-cam-docker.service
       sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/birdhouse-cam-docker.service

       # reload services
       sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   
       # register and install services
       sudo systemctl enable birdhouse-cam.service
       sudo systemctl start birdhouse-cam.service
       sudo systemctl enable birdhouse-cam-docker.service
       sudo systemctl start birdhouse-cam-docker.service
       ```

8. Examine logging messages if there are any problems, see (1.6)

#### (3) Direct installation

_Note:_ This installation is not fully tested yet. Recommend are (1) and (2).

1. Install birdhouse-cam prerequisites (see 2.2)
2. _Optional:_ Install CouchDB (no installation script available) or use JSON files as database
3. Create and adapt main configuration file, see (1.2)
4. Initial start to create a config file, see (2.5) and [First run and device configuration](#First-run-and-device-configuration)
5. Add lines to crontab to start on boot, see (2.7.i)
6. Examine logging messages if there are any problems, see (1.6)

#### (4) Update existing installation

Use ```sudo git pull``` in the root directory to get the latest state of the software.
If you're updating an existing installation it's highly recommend to back up you're current configuration and start with a fresh one:

* Remove your server config [.env](.env) and create a new one from the file [sample.env](sample.env)
* Remove your data and device configuration [data/config.json](data/config.json), when restarting the server a fresh one will be created.

When created the new files, adapt the new config files to your needs. Check the log files for errors, e.g., using ```./watchlog```.

### First run and device configuration

* Open your client (usually via http://your-hostname:8000/). 
When you run it the first time you'll be asked to check, change and save the settings.
* After that open the device settings and check, adapt, and save them also.
* _NOTE:_ if you want to add devices at the moment you have to edit the config file directly. 
It's stored as ./data/config.json.

### Finalize database setup

The default configuration of the database works without change but produces several error messages.
To remove those open the admin tool via http://your-hostname:5100/_utils/ and login
(default user:birdhouse, pwd:birdhouse - defined in the [.env](sample.env) file).
Go to the settings and create a single node.

### Accessing images via WebDAV

To access image and video files via WebDAV define credentials and port in the [.env](sample.env)-file and start docker container.

  ```bash
  $ sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-webdav.yml up -d
  ```

### Optimizing system configuration

At least for a Raspberry Pi 3B+ the following configuration should be done to ensure a slightly better performance.

#### Analyze memory and swap usage

* first analyze the usage of the docker containers to decide if there is need for action
    ```bash
    # overview memory and swap usage
    watch -n 2 free -h
    
    # overview memory usage per docker container (full and reduced)
    sudo docker stats
    sudo docker stats --format "table {{.Container}}\t{{.Name}}\t{{.MemUsage}}\t{{.MemPerc}}"
    ```
* NOTE: the file [sample.env](sample.env) defines memory limits that should fit for Raspberry Pi 3B+.

#### Set memory usage

In the file [.env](sample.env) there are memory limit defined for several components. This limits should work for
default usage. If an error 104 occurs in the CouchDB remove the limit for the respective container.

#### Configure swap file on Ubuntu

* Update swap memory (see also [https://bitlaunch.io/](https://bitlaunch.io/blog/how-to-create-and-adjust-swap-space-in-ubuntu-20-04/))
  ```bash
  sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
  sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
  sudo mkswap /swapfile
  sudo swapon /swapfile

  # options to check swap usage
  swapon --show
  free -h 
  ```
* Add swap memory permanently
    ```bash
    sudo echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
    ```

#### Configure swap file on Raspbian OS

* Update swap memory (usually 100MiB is set as default)
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
  
  # change the following values to:
  CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048
  CONF_SWAPFACTOR=2
  
  sudo systemctl restart dphys-swapfile
  
  # options to check swap usage
  swapon --show
  free -h 
  ```

#### Sample proxy server configuration

If you want to give access via internet you properly want to use a proxy such as NGINX. 
Therefor it's required to enable access to the following ports (if not changed default port settings):

* **App**: 80, 443
* **API**: 8007
* **Videostream**: 8008
* **Audiostream**: 8009

See a sample configuration (e.g. to forward http://birdhouse.your.domain:443 to http://your-server-ip:8000) 
here: [sample.nginx.conf](sample.nginx.conf). Ensure, that all used ports are publicly shared via your router.

#### External access via IPv6 if your internet provider doesn't offer NAT

If your provider doesn't offer Network Address Translation (NAT) another option is to get access via the IPv6 address
of your birdhouse server:

* Configure your router in a way that your birdhouse server is accessible from the internet by its IPv6 address.
* Install the PHP script in the folder [/app_forward](/app_forward) on an external webserver.
* Change the BIRDHOUSE_ID in the [.env](sample.env)-file if you want to use this entry point for more than one birdhouse.
* Change the BIRDHOUSE_APP_FORWARD in the [.env](sample.env)-file to the URL of your external webserver.
* Add the following command to the crontab on the birdhouse server using ```sudo crontab -e```.
    ```
    @reboot    /usr/bin/python3 /<path_to_script>/app_forward/request.py
    ```
* Open ```https://<your-external-server>/birdhouse/``` in your browser to get an easy link to your birdhouses
  using its IPv6 addresses.

## Train bird detection

The bird detection is based on a relatively simple training with a few singing birds. If you want to use and 
continuously improve your own detection model you can use the module [jc://bird-detection/](https://github.com/jc-prg/bird-detection/). 
Alternatively create a YOLOv8 model with different tools. Copy the *.pt file into the folder [data/custom_models/](data/custom_models/).

To use images from your own birdhouse, login as admin and go to the settings of an archived day. There you can download
the data of a full day or activate the collection of images for download. When you activated the second option you can
jump from day to day and mark all images you want to download. Use the icon in the header to start the download. In the
download file you'll find all images incl. the config files as well as in a separate folder a YOLOv8 file per image
and a file classes.txt with all labels of the model that has been used. Rename the labels_<model-name> folder to labels
and use the module [jc://bird-detection/](https://github.com/jc-prg/bird-detection/) to prepare the data and train your model.

## Helping stuff

* Check attached cameras and microphones
  ```bash
  # list video devices (install: apt-get install v4l2-ctl) 
  v4l2-ctl --list-devices
  
  # get available resolutions of a specific video device, e.g., /dev/video0
  v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --list-formats-ext
  
  # check available cameras - Raspbian 32bit OS
  vcgencmd get_camera
  
  # check available cameras / capture and save an image - Raspbian OS 64bit
  libcamera-hello --list-camera
  libcamera-jpeg -o test.jpg
    
  # check available audio devices
  arecord -l
  
  # set audio level
  amixer -c 2 -q set 'Mic',0 100%
  ```

* administrate docker
  ```bash
  # show running containers
  sudo docker ps
  
  # check storage used by docker stuff
  sudo docker system df
  sudo docker system df -v
  
  # show statistics such as memory and cpu usage
  sudo docker stats
  
  # clean up unused container, images, build cache, networks
  sudo docker system prune
  ```
